This project is a modification of the real project on youtube, to see the project click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI6e6qjJ8JQ)

### Features 

In this repo I have added fetures that were not addressed.

Features added were

- Background soundtrack
- In game different difficulties 

### DISCLAIMER

Unfortunately at the time I made this project i wasn't familiar in github, So I pushed everything in `main` and now the current last version is buggy and needs fixes, But tbh I am so lazy to fix them ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ

Would be great if someone wants to contrinute and fix them
